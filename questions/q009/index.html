<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

<p>Most popular browsers allow users to view the code of the page that they are currently viewing. In Windows, most popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge all use the keyboard shortcut <em><strong><u>Ctrl+U</u></strong></em> to access the source code. It might also be possible to view the source code by right clicking on an empty space on the page and selecting <em><strong><u>"View Page Source"</u></strong></em>. Comments in html are enclosed within &lt;!-- and --&gt; tags. </p>
