<p>The Thanjavur Big Temple (Brihadeeswara Temple) is a famous temple dedicated to Shivan, built
by Rajaraja Cholan in the 11<sup>th</sup> Century. The Shiva Linga in the main shrine is 8.7m in height, making it one of the
largest in India. It also has a large shrine for Nandi facing the main shrine, and other smaller shrines for various other deities.</p>

<p>At the North-Western corner of the temple, there is a small blue sign
board on the floor, leaning against the wall, located in the outer shrine complex. What is the last English word on
that sign?</p>
