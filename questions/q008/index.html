<p>Ramanan was telling Rashana about a website he had created a long time ago, when he was much younger. 
She was intrigued and asked him what the title of the website was, but he couldn't recollect it. 
With the intention of accessing the website to check the title, Ramanan opened a web browser and confidently typed in <a href="http://home1.pacific.net.sg/~ramanan/" target="_blank">http://home1.pacific.net.sg/~ramanan/</a>.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, his old internet provider had gone out of business, and as a result, the website was no longer available on the internet.</p>

<p>If only he could go <strong>wayback</strong> to 5<sup>th</sup> December 1998, when his website was still accessible on the internet, he could then show it to Rashana.</p>

<h3>Can you help Ramanan find his long-lost website and tell Rashana what its title was?</h3>
